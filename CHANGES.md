# Changes

## 2026-06-08

- Guarded `drawRect` against missing graphics contexts and zero-size bounds.
- Changed the wave loop to draw within the clamped wave count instead of one
  extra wave.
- Extended the waveform checker to protect context, bounds, and loop-count
  contracts.
- Added a Makefile verification gate for podspec syntax, package metadata, and
  waveform drawing safety.
- Updated root CocoaPods metadata URLs to HTTPS and matched the GitHub repo URL
  casing.
- Guarded waveform drawing against zero wave counts and non-positive density
  steps from Interface Builder/runtime configuration.
- Documented local verification steps.
